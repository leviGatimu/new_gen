### 1. 🌓 **Smart Dark/Light Mode**
A custom JavaScript engine (`theme.js`) detects user preference and saves it to LocalStorage. It persists across all pages—from the Login screen to the Report Card generator.
- **Tech:** CSS Variables (`:root` vs `[data-theme="dark"]`) & Vanilla JS.

### 2. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Parent Portal (The "Super App")**
Parents get a comprehensive dashboard to manage their child's academic life without visiting the school.
- **Financial Tracking:** Real-time view of School Fees (Paid vs Owed in RWF) with visual indicators for overdue payments and equipment loans.
- **Child Switching:** One parent account can link to multiple students via unique **Access Codes**.
- **Report Cards:** Auto-generated, printable A4 report cards with grades and signatures.

### 3. 💬 **Real-Time Teacher-Parent Messaging**
A built-in chat interface that mimics modern social apps.
- **Blue/Orange Bubbles:** Distinct visual styling for Sender vs Receiver.
- **Teacher List:** Auto-fetched contact list for all teachers assigned to the student's class.

### 4. 📚 **Homework & Holiday Packages**
- **Teachers:** Can upload assignments (PDF/Word) via a secure portal.
- **Parents:** Can view and download holiday packages directly from their dashboard.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & "Cool" Code

### **Frontend (The Visuals)**
We skipped heavy frameworks to build a blazing fast, custom UI.
* **Glassmorphism Header:** A semi-transparent, blurred navigation bar (`backdrop-filter: blur(12px)`) that floats over content.
* **CSS Grid & Flexbox:** Fully responsive layouts for dashboards and fee grids.
* **Interactive Hover Effects:** Buttons and cards lift (`transform: translateY(-2px)`) and glow on hover.

### **Backend (The Logic)**
* **Core:** Native PHP (No frameworks) for maximum control and performance on local XAMPP servers.
* **Database:** MySQL with relational tables linking `Parents` ↔ `Students` ↔ `Teachers` ↔ `Classes`.
* **Security:** Password hashing (`password_verify`), PDO prepared statements (SQL Injection protection), and Session-based role authentication.
